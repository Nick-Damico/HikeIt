    title "LeConte Mountain Adventure"
    description "If ever there was a classic hike in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Alum Cave Trail to Mt. LeConte would certainly qualify. Sure, there are hikes in the Smokies that are far longer, gain more elevation, or have steeper climbs, but the Alum Cave Trail is unmatched in its combination of interesting geological features, history, high adventure and stunning panoramic views."
